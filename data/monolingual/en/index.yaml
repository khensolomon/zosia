# File: data/monolingual/zo/index.yaml
#
# Description:
#   This file acts as a manifest to control which Zolai monolingual text
#   files are used for training the Zolai tokenizer. A larger and more
#   diverse set of monolingual data will result in a better, more robust
#   tokenizer.
#
# Instructions:
#   - Add the full filename of each text file to the 'files' list.
#   - To exclude a file from the next tokenizer training run, comment it out
#     with a '#'.
