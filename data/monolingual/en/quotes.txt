AI is a tool. The choice about how it gets deployed is ours.
The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race... It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.
Artificial intelligence will reach human levels by around 2029. Follow that out further to, say, 2045, we will have multiplied the intelligence, the human biological machine intelligence of our civilization a billion-fold.
I imagine a world in which AI is going to make us work more productively, live longer, and have cleaner energy.

The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that men may become robots.
