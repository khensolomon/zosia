#
# Description:
#   This file acts as a manifest to control which parallel (bilingual)
#   datasets are included in the processing and training pipeline.
#
# Instructions:
#   - IMPORTANT: To train a good model, you MUST uncomment 'train' and 'val'.
#   - Add the base name of the file pairs to the 'corpora' list.
#   - For example, if you have 'animals.en' and 'animals.zo', add 'animals'.
#   - The processing script will automatically look for both the .en and .zo
#     files corresponding to each base name listed here.

  # - "animal"
  # - "noun"
