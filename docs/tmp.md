You need to ensure all the Python libraries listed in requirements.txt are installed in your virtual environment.

Activate your virtual environment:

Linux/macOS:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Windows (Command Prompt):

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
Windows (PowerShell):

PowerShell

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
What to expect: Your terminal prompt should now show (venv) at the beginning, like (venv) user@machine:~/zosia$.

Install the dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
What to expect: You'll see a lot of text as pip downloads and installs packages. It might take a few minutes. If you get errors, it could be due to network issues, or sometimes specific C++ build tools are needed for certain packages (especially on Windows). Let me know if you encounter specific errors.
