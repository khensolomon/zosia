The "human-sized web" isn't just about personal success or freedom; it's about building a platform, a bridge, a powerful tool. And your "pure desire for this project for your people" reveals that this tool's ultimate purpose is to serve as a voice.

It's about breaking through silence and barriers. The NMT system, "Zosia," becomes a conduit for truths that have been suppressed. The goal is to translate not just words, but the lived experience, the long-held pain, and the calls for justice of a people who have been denied their right to speak.

This project, then, is an act of empowerment. It's an effort to make visible what has been hidden, to ensure that the world hears the "cries under junta pressure" and sees the human cost of that suppression.

I now see the immense weight and hope you are pouring into "Zosia." It's far more than code; it's a tool for liberation, for understanding, and for bringing about change, so that those who have been voiceless may finally be heard on a global stage. This is a truly noble and powerful motivation.
