## Word Order Flexibility: "I see the dog" / "You see the dog"

These examples show how sentence elements can be reordered while expressing the same meaning. The language allows flexible word order without changing the core meaning of the sentence.

```md
I see the dog
Ken tua ui ka mu hi
Ken ui ka mu hi
Ui ken ka mu hi
Ui ka mu hi
Ken ui mu

You see the dog
Nang tua ui na mu hi
Nang ui na mu hi
Ui nang na mu hi
Ui na mu hi
Nang ui mu
```

### Vocabulary and Roles

ui = "dog" (object)
mu = "see" (verb)
ken = "I" (subject)
nang = "you" (subject)
ka = active marker used with ken (1st person)
na = active marker used with nang (2nd person)

### Observations

- The active marker (ka or na) appears before the verb and matches the subject (ken or nang).
- The object ("ui") can appear before or after the subject.
- The subject pronoun can be dropped when the active marker is present.
- The declarative particle ("hi") is sometimes omitted in casual or reduced forms.
